/* mtlc/build.h - a public IR builder for frontends.
 *
 * This is how a frontend that is NOT the reference Mettle frontend constructs
 * libmtlc IR without touching the backend's internal headers. You describe
 * functions and an imperative instruction stream through opaque handles; the
 * builder produces an MtlcModule (see mtlc/module.h) ready for the pipeline
 * (mtlc_optimize -> mtlc_emit_object -> mtlc_link_executable in mtlc/pipeline.h).
 *
 * The model mirrors the backend IR: values are SSA-like temporaries or named
 * locals/parameters, referenced by opaque MtlcValue handles; control flow is
 * explicit labels and branches (the frontend lowers its own if/while/for). A
 * function whose body you emit is a definition; declare an `extern` function to
 * reference a symbol linked from elsewhere (e.g. a C runtime routine).
 *
 *   MtlcBuilder *b = mtlc_builder_create();
 *   const MtlcType *i64 = mtlc_type_scalar(MTLC_TYPE_INT64);
 *   MtlcFn *f = mtlc_builder_function(b, "main", i64, NULL, NULL, 0, 0);
 *   MtlcValue r = mtlc_const_int(f, i64, 42);
 *   mtlc_return(f, r);
 *   MtlcModule *m = mtlc_builder_finish(b);   // b is consumed
